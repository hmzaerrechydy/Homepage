          <h1>One problem with to do lists </h1>
          <br/>
            <p>To do lists are great but there’s a big problem with them: expectations!</p>
<p>When you wake up, and you start writing a to do list you are actually writing your expectations of the day and how it supposed to be.</p>
<p>The problem is that days are not unique, they are not templates or copies.</p>
<p>Each day is unique.</p>
<p>Once you finish writing the to do list, you start working, and by the end of the day if all the tasks (expectations) are complete then you are happy, if not then it’s a failure, not productive day.</p>
<p>That’s wrong, because you can’t get the same output each day, why? Because your environment, tools, energy, people, ideas, … are not static things, they are dynamic, and if those variables got change then your output too will change.</p>
<p>Seek to do what you can do not what you want to do.</p>
<p>Keep your to do list flexible and make it adopt to your real life and condition not imagination and expectations.</p>
