          <h1>Hard days, easy days!</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>A productive life is a long one.</p>
<p>You will get tired if you rush.</p>
<p>Burnout happens because of doing hard things without a break in between.</p>
<p>You need easy days as you need hard days!</p>
<p>Letâ€™s take exercise as an example, I exercise every other day and I let myself a day in between to recover, rest and do other things.</p>
<p>Try to make two or three days per week where you go a little bit easier on yourself.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If you want to build habits for life, do meaningful work for years, play the long term game then you need to avoid burn out and procrastination and to do that you need to keep your days / weeks balanced and smooth.</p>
