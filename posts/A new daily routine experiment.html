          <h1>A new daily routine experiment</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>This week I’m running an experiment: a new daily routine.</p>
<p>My current daily routine is to spend the morning and afternoon doing only productive things: studying, reading, exercise, journaling, blogging, … and I chill and relax in the evening and sleep in the night.</p>
<p>This week I want to give more time to rest, in the morning I will be as productive as I can, and spend the rest of the day resting and do whatever I like.</p>
<p>Morning = Productivity(studying, exercise, writing, …)</p>
<p>Afternoon + Evening = Rest, chill and entertainment</p>
<p>Night = Sleep</p>
<p>Why I’m doing this? I don’t believe in weekends, vacations and retirement, instead of burning out now and promise myself some rest at the end of the week or in summer I prefer instead to bring balance to my days, my current routine is great at achieving that but I wondered if I could give myself even more rest and still be productive or be more productive and increase my energy and focus.</p>
<p>Note: I will still do things I have to do, non-optional work, during the rest period of my day if there’s any.</p>
<p>It’s Monday, the first day of the experiment.</p>
<p>On Sunday I will share the results, insights, lessons, failures … and anything I learned from this experience and what my daily routine will look like whether I will go back to my current routine, adopt this new routine or have a mix between them.</p>
