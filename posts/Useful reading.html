          <h1>Useful reading</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Reading is great but you need to make effort to gain the fruits of reading.</p>
<p>Just reading a book, then ignore it for the rest of your life, sure have some benefits but not that much.</p>
<p>So what’s the solution?</p>
<p>Don’t abandon your books after reading them!</p>
<p>Use books as a reference.</p>
<p>Keep your books, and keep going back to them.</p>
<p>Whenever you encounter a problem there’s a book you’ve read that might contain a solution.</p>
<p>Visit a book you have read from time to time, like an old friend, to find something useful you can apply into your life.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine you are a writer, and you have read a great book about writing, after reading it, you can go back to it whenever you encounter a writing problem, use it to enhance your next piece of writing, take new ideas and apply them, … etc.</p>
<p>You need to use books not only read them.</p>
<p>Deploy what you read into the process of what you do and in the process of life in general, in all aspects. </p>
