          <h1>Real learning</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Real learning happens in the real world!</p>
<p>Books, blogs, videos, tutorials, podcasts, articles, courses, … this stuff are cool and good but dangerous!</p>
<p>There’s a difference between learning something and learning about something, if you all you do is consuming content all day long then you will never learn a skill because all you do is collecting information about the topic.</p>
<p>Consume content for a little bit of time daily and when you need to figure out how something works, that way content will motivate you, and provide the information you need at the right time, but if you consume content all day then it’s just procrastination, it’s like reading about cooking, watching TV programs about it, but never hitting the kitchen and trying to prepare something to eat! </p>
<p>For example if you want to become a programmer and all you do is taking courses, watching tutorials, reading blogs, … then you will never become a programmer, you will know the basics but you will never leave this level.</p>
<p>The solution?</p>
<p>It’s simple and very known: learn by doing.</p>
<p>Go to school; study hard.</p>
<p>Read books.</p>
<p>But spend the rest of your time doing or building something: write a blog, build a startup, record a podcast, make software, freelance, …</p>
<p>Get yourself into a project, it doesn’t have to be a life time commitment, try and experiment, what matter is learning and the experience you will gain.</p>
<p>Why? To learn or to earn.</p>
<p>When you learn by doing you will face real problems and by solving this problems you will develop skills, and gain experience.</p>
<p>The best case scenario is your project will take off and you can work on it for the next five or ten years.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario:</p>
<p>You will build a portfolio of real work that you can get a good job with.</p>
<p>You will develop new skills; knowledge and get to know new people.</p>
<p>You will have fun! Going trough a novel experience is an amazing thing.</p>
<p>But I don’t know what to do? I don’t have an idea! Just pick something, if it is a project that you can learn from then go for it, it might take off and succeed or you can quit and jump to the next thing.</p>
<p>Is quitting right?! It feels bad to quit something you started, but quitting after you’ve gain real experience, develop new skills and learned new things is a great thing at that stage you are free to try something new, but if you start things and you quit after a few days without learning anything then I agree it’s a bad habit.</p>
