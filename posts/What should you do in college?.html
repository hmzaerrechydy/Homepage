          <h1>What should you do in college?</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>My first year in college is about to finish, I will describe my experience so far in one word: Chaos! </p>
<p>It was a storm of problems and endless questions about everything: studying, time management, learning new skills, gaining experience, building a business, … </p>
<p>After all of this I can say that I have a clear vision of what a college student should do in this period of 3 to 4 years. </p>
<p>I have learned that I should do two things: learning and networking. </p>
<p>Learning: develop a body of knowledge, acquire new skills and gain experience. To do that there’s endless ways to do so, read books, take online MOOCS in different fields, build stuff like a startup or an open source for example. Why? After college you will need this skills, knowledge and experience to launch your career in a world of hyper competition. </p>
<p>Networking: you need to make new relationships with people that can help you to learn and attract opportunities to your way, you can do this offline in college, events, … also online trough social media, even blogging can be considered a way to network and get to know new people who will stumble across your blog posts. This is also will make the launch of your career after graduation easier. </p>
<p>This blog post is for me to clarify my vision for the rest of college. </p>
