          <h1>The traditional path </h1>
          <br/>
            <p>The problem is if you want to do something you like you will need to make decisions for yourself, but because you are young and you don’t have experience you will make for sure the wrong ones, to learn, and then you will have a foundation of failures you can afterward use to make your own path. </p>
<p>For example I spent 2 years after high school just making mistakes, I started college but stopped going, I tried to learn code multiple times but I start and quit, I tried to blog, freelance, … </p>
<p>But I learned many skills: time management, learning how to learn, discipline, … but at a cost: time. </p>
<p>Currently you have two options follow the traditional path, or make your own, but remember that will come with a cost. </p>
<p>We need a third option with security but also freedom to experiment,. </p>
<p>But I my advice for younger self is to follow the traditional path while learning and experimenting on the side so I can take the best of both worlds.</p>
