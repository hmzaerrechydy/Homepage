          <h1>How to make a great resume?</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Article source: <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2023/01/24/what-we-look-for-in-a-candidate.html">https://huyenchip.com/2023/01/24/what-we-look-for-in-a-candidate.html</a></p>
<p>Every company hires differently.</p>
<p>a candidate should apply to a startup differently from how they’d apply to a big company.</p>
<p>We look for reasons to say yes.</p>
<p>Your resume should include unique things that differentiate you from the next 100 resumes, stuff you only did, talk about this stuff, highlight them, explain them, and show what you’ve learned from them. </p>
<p>Put the stuff the company you are applying to is looking for in your resume. </p>

<p>The above list is useless, here’s why: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It’s unconvincing</strong>. There’s a big gap between “saying that you know something” and “being good at it.”<ul>
<li>Don’t tell that you know something, show them, link to a project, to a proof.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>It can weaken your resume</strong>. For example, if you consider common skills like Jupyter notebook and git your competitive advantage (the only reason to include them in your resume), I would automatically assume that you have no other competitive advantage.<ul>
<li>Because all other applicants write the same stuff so you are not unique.</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>large companies that receive an influx of resumes, recruiters set rules to surface resumes that contain certain keywords. Candidates, not sure what these keywords are, populate their resumes with all the keywords they can think of.</p>
<p><strong>Show how you acquired and use that skill in your job.</strong> </p>
<p>Share your expertise on public channels such as: StackOverflow answers, open source contributions, papers, blog posts. </p>
<p>Here are some examples that convinced me of a candidate’s expertise in certain technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>A candidate sent us their StackOverflow profile where they have answered over 100 questions on JavaScript.</li>
<li>Another sent us a list of their merged PRs to PyTorch.</li>
<li>Another sent us a blog post that covers in-depth detail about X that made our team go: “whoa, they really know about X.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We look for people who get things done.</strong> </p>
<p>There are two traits we look for to evaluate whether a candidate can get things done: initiatives and persistence. If you have experience that demonstrates these, please do include them in your resume.</p>
<h3 id="initiatives"><strong>Initiatives</strong></h3>
<p>To get anything done, you need to start it. There are a lot of people who can see a problem, but few who would do something about it. We want people who, when seeing a problem, proactively do something about it without waiting to be told. We look for initiatives a candidate has started before, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A student club, an event, a team, a project at work. A project that you initiate doesn’t have to be about something new. Projects like writing documents or improving existing CI/CD are also extremely valuable.</li>
<li>A startup. A founder told me that his best hires are people who have previously founded a company, even if that company didn’t work out. They know the drill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we’ve started something, we need persistence to drive it to completion.</p>
<p>I’m a bit hesitant when I see candidates who change jobs too frequently, e.g. 5 different companies in 5 years. I understand that not all jobs work out, so it’s okay, sometimes necessary, to move on. However, consistent job jumping can imply that you get bored or give up easily. A year at a job is hardly enough to get deep into a problem space and make significant contributions.</p>
<p>Working at a startup can be tough, and we don’t want someone who joins and leaves at the first sign of challenge. We want someone to stick around and help us through different phases. This process, I hope, can also provide you with a diverse set of experiences to prepare you for whatever you want to do after.</p>
<p>Startups like ours exist to solve a problem that few others can solve. This requires us to see the problem from a perspective that most people don’t.</p>
<p>Your unique perspective can be demonstrated in your career/life choices, your writing, your side projects.</p>
<p>Cookie-cutter projects happen when someone simply replicates a common solution to a popular project – titanic, sentiment analysis of tweets, stock trading, chatbots – without any new approach or insight. I see them in about ⅓ of all the resumes we’ve received. These projects are good to practice on. I myself practiced on them when I started. However, they won’t help you stand out as a candidate.</p>
<p><strong>We care about impact, not meaningless metrics.</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all that are quantifiable are impactful. Showing the number of code reviews you’ve participated in, without any context, doesn’t say anything flattering. It’d be better if you could show how the learnings from all these code reviews are relevant to the role you’re applying for: e.g. how they helped you become a better engineer.</p>
<p>I do care about metrics. I especially appreciate metrics that are presented with two components:</p>
<ol>
<li>How they can be tied to business objectives.</li>
<li>Your contribution in achieving that metric.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Not all impact has metrics</strong>
Fixing a bug or helping a coworker out is impactful, but hard to measure. It’s a great signal when your work receives awards and recognitions, such as:</p>
<p>An internal company award (e.g. intern of the year, MVP, founder award, winning hackathon)
Promotions, e.g. I was impressed with a candidate that went from being a data scientist to a senior MLE to a staff MLE within 4 years.
Glowing recommendations from previous teammates and managers. We actually made an offer to a candidate after two of their references talked about how much this candidate helped and mentored them.</p>
<p>The goal of a resume is not to show&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;about you. The goal is to put your best foot forward to show a company why you’d be an excellent addition to their team. Rarely do I see a candidate whose best foot forward can’t be contained within one page.</p>
<h3 id="sometipstoshortenyourresume">Some tips to shorten your resume</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find repetition and remove them. For example, do you need to list all 5 of your personal projects, or the top 3 would suffice?</li>
<li>Remove irrelevant experience, even if that creates gaps in your resume. Personally, I don’t care about gaps – everyone needs time to recharge and take care of personal matters.</li>
<li>Most resumes I’ve seen can have shorter education sections.</li>
<li>Remove common skills, e.g. git, notebook, MS Word/Excel.</li>
<li>Find a more efficient format, e.g. using multiple columns.</li>
<li>Reduce font size, page margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have, however, been impressed by candidates who make up for their lack of experience in our field with impressive experiences in other fields.</p>
<h1 id="generaltips">General tips</h1>
<ol>
<li>If you’re applying to a small startup, say, of less than 20 people, spend some time researching who works at that startup and email them directly.</li>
<li>Send your resume as a PDF instead of an editable format like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. The editable format might not render correctly on other people’s computers.</li>
<li>If you can get someone who used to supervise you to talk about how great you are, include their quote in your resume. Quotes from friends/family don’t count.</li>
<li>Don’t use abbreviations unless you know for sure your audience knows what you’re talking about.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="publiclinks">Public links</h1>
<ol>
<li>If you’ve contributed to open source projects, include links to the PRs or a public architectural design you’re the most proud of.</li>
<li>If your GitHub has a lot of repos, pin the important ones on your homepage (you can pin up to 6). You can also write a README to guide your visitors on what repos they would look at.</li>
<li>Don’t include a link to your GitHub link if it’s empty.</li>
<li>If you have publications, link to your Google Scholar profile.</li>
<li>If you’re a co-author of a paper with multiple authors, bold your name in the author list.</li>
<li>If you have more to show than your resume allows, create a personal website. Assuming that you have basic coding skills, it’s fairly easy to create a free personal website using GitHub Pages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Resume building is an ongoing process: continuously improve the experience, skills, recommendations, etc. that you have. If you’re good at building, you might not even have to write a resume. If your work catches companies’ attention, they’ll reach out to you.</p>
