          <h1>Learning in rabbit holes! </h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Curiosity is good but dangerous!</p>
<p>Learning is like jumping into a rabbit hole in which you will find thousands of other rabbit holes!</p>
<p>When learning remember one basic fact: You canâ€™t learn everything.</p>
<p>Keep your focus on the book, MOOC, or project between your hands, and minimize your research on other external resources as much as possible.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well because you can spend the rest of your life researching stuff from one rabbit hole to another and never finish the original learning project, so in order to make progress and finish what you started you need to research less.</p>
<p>Keep research only when necessary and go back to your track as fast as possible.</p>
