          <h1>Pick up one</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Life is not a portfolio. -Zero to One</p>
<p>You need to be bold, you have to pick up one thing, you gotta stand for something.</p>
<p>It’s easy to not make a choice, but it’s painful and very hard to stick with something for years.</p>
<p>Remember one simple fact: you have limited time and energy and you can’t do it all.</p>
<p>Therefore you have to get into the momentum of making choices and taking sides.</p>
<p>A small example: read book X instead of thousands of other books that you could also read.</p>
<p>A big example: picking up career X instead of thousands of other potential careers.</p>
