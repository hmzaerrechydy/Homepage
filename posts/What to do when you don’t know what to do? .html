<p>Do permissionless things. </p>
<p>Things you can do without any prerequisites or someone saying Yes!</p>
<p>Especially when you don’t have money, skills and experience. </p>
<p>Or when you are stuck in life and don’t know what to do. </p>
<p>Examples of permissionless things to do: </p>
<ul>
<li>Reading a book</li>
<li>Building a business</li>
<li>Studying a field like computer science using books and free online resources</li>
<li>Building an application</li>
<li>Writing a blog</li>
<li>Doing free freelance work</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s unlimited amount of things you can do without the permission of anybody, your choice depends on the situation you are in now. </p>
<p>For example: I’m a college student now, I study English, I know that this will not lead to an interesting job, so I do permissionless things on the side: blogging, learning computer science and programming, using social media (twitter and LinkedIn), this things are free to do (if you have a computer and internet connection of course) and helps you make progress toward the outcome you want, whether it’s getting a job, finding more clients, … there’s no trick to do when you face a hard problem there’s only some sort of work you need to do for free and thank God almighty there’s a lot of permissionless things to do. </p>
<p>Another thing I love about permissionless things is that you are in control of how you do stuff, you have the freedom and no one is controlling how you do things and giving you work that is useless and will not help you achieve your goal, you are the manager, but this comes with responsibility of getting good at managing yourself and what you do. </p>
