          <h1>Learn to evaluate yourself</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Learning to evaluate yourself and your work is one of the most important skills you need to live a productive life.</p>
<p>When you spend time, effort and energy into something then you did a good job.</p>
<p>Measuring time is easy, but what about effort and energy? When it hurts, when you struggle, when you get tired, when it is uncomfortable, when you want to quit, … there’s a lot of metrics you can use to know whether you’re working hard enough or not.</p>
<p>Don’t judge by details but with the whole! For example judge the past hour by the overall achievement and work you did not with the tiny mistakes and the minute or two you spent doing nothing, you are not a robot, you are human, learn to judge time by hours and days, and what you do by big actions or huge mistakes, tiny stuff like losing concentration for a minute staring at the wall is a normal thing.</p>
