          <h1>Rethinking hard work </h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Hard work, what do you think about when you hear this two words? Whenever I think of working hard I imagine myself spending 10 hours or maybe more each day working, studying, …</p>
<p>That’s how we market this concept of working hard, I have a different view or philosophy: work hard on consistency over the years not intensity on few days or months, let me explain for example each year people try to start reading, they are motivated and they want to become readers, so they decided to read 100 book by the end of the year, they start reading each day, some days they spend hours just reading, they are perfect, they are making progress, they do this because they believe that in order to become a reader you need to work hard on it, and working hard for them is doing it that way, but after a couple of days, weeks or in the best scenario months they stop and quit suddenly, they abandon reading for months again and by the next year they start thinking and dreaming of the same thing, it’s an infinite loop, we all have been there whether it’s with reading, exercise, studying … </p>
<p>Hard work is not the hours you spent working on something each day, but your consistency rate over the years, you will find huge number of people who are reading today for hours, but you will find only few who had stick to the habit of reading every day in the past 10 or 20 years, and this people are the real readers with the huge cool libraries. </p>
<p>Switch your mindset from focusing on how many hours you put in today to how many days you made progress on in the previous years, seek being more consistent over being intense on the individual days, that’s probably why days are short and years are long! </p>
