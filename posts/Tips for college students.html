          <h1>Tips for college students</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>These are the decisions people commonly make that have the most negative effects on their ability to start a startup:</p>
<ul>
<li>They didn’t learn how to write code.</li>
<li>They never met anyone who knew how to write code in college.</li>
<li>They significantly increased their expenses early in life, didn’t save, and now can’t afford to begin their company.</li>
<li>They created roots post-college in a city that is not startup friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learntocode">Learn to code</h3>
<p>Being a programmer gives you the ability to work in any industry and start a company in any industry.</p>
<h3 id="meetpeoplewithrealskills"><strong>Meet people with real skills</strong></h3>
<p>Make friends with people who have different skills than your own.</p>
<pre><code>Because you can’t learn everything, and to build a startup you need a team. 
</code></pre>
<h3 id="takeresponsibility"><strong>Take responsibility</strong></h3>
<p>College is a great opportunity to learn more about how you operate within a group setting.</p>
<p>Learn what you are good and bad at when it comes to working with others.</p>
<pre><code>You will learn what kind of manager you are. 
</code></pre>
<h3 id="bereadytohitthegroundrunning"><strong>Be ready to hit the ground running</strong></h3>
<p>In American culture today it's seen as acceptable to use your 20s to find yourself. I firmly disagree with this idea. Your 20s are your most valuable working years: You often have very few obligations (no family), a very low burn rate (you’re used to living in a dorm), and you are still young enough to meet new people and learn new skills. Use college to to get the partying out of your system and spend your 20s working hard.</p>
<h3 id="beyourowncareercounselor"><strong>Be your own career counselor</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of putting all your raw effort into your coursework and grades, use some of your time at school to figure out what you want to do when you graduate.</p>
<p>You can always change your mind, but having a plan is better than no plan.</p>
<p>Imagine two people X and Y, X decided to build a startup, he spent two years building one, but he fails, then he changed his mind and want to join a company, because of his experience he have skills, a portfolio and relationships that could help get a job, but Y on the other hand didn’t pick a plan, he did nothing for two years, even if he change his mind to start something he will start from the ground, with zero skills, relationships, … etc that’s why having a plan is better than no plan. </p>
<h3 id="itsokaytoignoreyourparents"><strong>It's okay to ignore your parents</strong></h3>
<p>The problem is if you want to do something you like you will need to make decisions for yourself, but because you are young and you don’t have experience you will make for sure the wrong ones, to learn, and then you will have a foundation of failures you can afterward use to make your own path, for example I spent 2 years after high school just making mistakes, but I learned many skills, but at a cost, currently you have two options follow the traditional path, or make your own, but remember that will come with a cost, we need a third option with security but also freedom to experiment, but I think my advice for myself younger self is to follow the traditional path while learning and experimenting on the side so I can take the best of both worlds. </p>
