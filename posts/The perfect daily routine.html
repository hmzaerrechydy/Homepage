          <h1>The perfect daily routine</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>I finished the new daily routine experiment!</p>
<p>Read this blog post to learn more about this experiment. [LINK]</p>
<p>The previous week I decided to be productive only during the mornings and spend the rest of the day resting and doing whatever I like.</p>
<p>I spent 7 days living that way and here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
<p>First thing this routine is obviously perfectly balanced, I had a huge window to rest and enjoy my time without any burnout.</p>
<p>It kept me focused, because I had a small period of time during the day where I need to be productive that pushed me to focus and stay on track to finish as much work as I can without any procrastination.</p>
<p>One obvious down side is I had less time to do what I want to do.</p>
<p>The experiment is done but I will not quit this daily routine forever, this routine is great for days where I want to have more free time for whatever reason.</p>
<p>For example if I’m physically, mentally or emotionally tired then I can switch this easy routine to make sure I make progress and at the same time give myself more time to rest.</p>
