            <h2 id="hexadecimal">Hexadecimal</h2>
<p>It’s base 16 which means there’s 16 digits you can use to represent a number. </p>
<p>0 to 9 plus A, B, C, D, E, F which equals 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. </p>
<p>You can represent two digits, each represent a column, 1 and 16, so for example A under the 1 column is 10 and 1 under the 16 column is 16. </p>
<p>FF is the highest value in this system: 16 * 15 + 15 * 1 = 255 </p>
<p>The prefix 0x is used in code to indicate that the number is being written in hex.</p>
<p>&amp; get you the address of a value in memory. </p>
<p>A pointer is a variable that points to the address of another variable.  </p>

<p>A string variable is just a char pointer that refers to the address of the first char in a string and thanks to the null character we can follow the bread crumbs till we find the end of the string and get all the characters. </p>
<pre><code class="c language-c">char *s = "Hello, world!"; 

// [1] get the address of the first char 
// [2] go to memory and find the address 
// [3] access all values until the null character \0
</code></pre>
<p>Once you create a pointer you can get the value stored in the address you’re pointing at using *</p>
<pre><code class="c language-c">char *name = "Hamza"; 
int *p = &amp;name; // pointer 

printf("My name is %c\n", *p); // access value in the pointer address  
</code></pre>
<p>You can do arithmetic with pointer, since a string is an array of character back to back, then the next character is plus 1 from the current character address. </p>
<pre><code class="c language-c">char *fruit = "apple"; 
char one = *fruit; 
char two = *(fruit + 1); 

printf("second chraceter in apple is : %c\n", two); // p 
</code></pre>
<p>The computer memory gives you a segment you can use if you try to pass to the rest of memory you will get an error. </p>
<p><strong>malloc()</strong> is a function in C that let us use a chunk of memory by passing the number of bytes we need as an argument.  </p>
<p>In design it’s not good to call a function inside a loop because it’s stupid to call the function in each iteration when you could called it once and store the returned value inside a variable. </p>
<p>NULL pointer is a pointer that does not point to any memory location “an invalid memory location”. </p>
<p>If you pass NULL to a variable it become a NULL pointer. </p>
<p>NULL is useful for handling malloc() errors. </p>
<p><strong>free()</strong> is a function we use to free the chunk of memory we have been using from malloc(). </p>
<p>Any time you use malloc() you have to use free(). </p>
<p>If you don’t initialize variables you will get <strong>garbage values</strong>, values from other programs that were running in that part of memory. </p>
<p>When you pass values to a function, you are only providing copies.</p>

<p>The heap is free available space in memory that we can use malloc() to use. </p>
<p>The stack is the variables and arguments passed to a function. </p>
