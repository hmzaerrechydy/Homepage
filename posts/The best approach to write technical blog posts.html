          <h1>The best approach to write technical blog posts</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>I’ve tried to write a technical blog post explaining a coding problem I’ve solved. </p>
<p>That’s sounds great, but I’ve found that I made a mistake, or in other words I’ve discovered that I was trying to write this post in the hard way. </p>
<p>The better approach that I should have followed is to take a lot of notes while solving the problem, while being in the zone, while the ideas and the problem is fresh in my mind. </p>
<p>The lesson I’ve learned is that if I want to write technical blog posts I will take notes while learning, building and solving problems, then later I can take this notes and edit them easily. </p>
<p>It’s hard to get back in the same head-space you were in while solving the problem, that’s the best time to explain what you were doing. </p>
