          <h1>The monster of doubt</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Ebooks or physical books? Gym or running? Blogging or social media? Python or Java? Tea or coffee?</p>
<p>We are obsessed with this questions, and we waste hours, weeks, months and years debating and thinking about the perfect choice. From deciding on which school to go to, picking up a career to the small things like which book to read next.</p>
<p>Here’s a secret: most things work, if you stick long enough!</p>
<p>Our problem is we don’t want to make a choice in life until we are 100% sure, here is another secret you will never be, doubt, uncertainty and chaos are here to stay.</p>
<p>Clarity is a choice.</p>
<p>You need to be brave and stand for something.</p>
<p>Most things we think about doing are good choices, for example if you chose running over the Gym and you make it a habit for years you will be very proud of the results and effects, you will be healthy and that’s what matter.</p>
<p>The dangerous thing is that to gain results from doing something you need to wait for a long period, years usually, so if you don’t make choices and you doubt everything in your life you will never see any results from the things you do for short term periods.</p>
<p>Just make sure it’s a good choice and it improved people’s lives before you.</p>
<p>One of the strongest obstacles in life is this hidden monster of doubt inside us that want us just to think and dream instead of work and do, don’t feed it, get into the momentum of making choices.</p>
