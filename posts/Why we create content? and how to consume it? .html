<p>We create content to help those who are building or doing something to fill the gaps they have and resolve the issues they face, consuming content for the sake of consuming content is the worst kind of investment you can make with your time, there’s limitless amount of content on the internet, how can you consume it all? </p>
<p>You don’t have to, this is not the reason this things are created for, Google and YouTube are a search engine so when you have a problem you go and find someone who faced the same problem and solve it whether it’s a course, blog post, videos, podcast, book … this makes your consumption of this content much useful, but consuming content just like a machine and you are waiting for something to happen is a stupid idea and will not help you that much. </p>
<p>Do or build something is a much better and rich experience to have. </p>
