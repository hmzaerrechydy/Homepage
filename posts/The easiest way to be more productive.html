          <h1>The easiest way to be more productive</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>You don’t have to do things in one shot!</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to read a book today, you don’t have to block an hour in which you sit down and read that book, that’s the one shot approach to doing things, instead you can read whenever you can during they day, each time you read a little bit, 30 minutes after breakfast, 8 minutes while preparing a cup of coffee, 40 minutes in the bus, 5 minutes when you have nothing to do, you get it.</p>
<p>This is more flexible approach, it doesn’t cost you time actually it helps you invest the time you will be loosing any way in some lower value activity, and more efficient, you will find out that you’ve read more than one hour at the end of the day.</p>
<p>You can apply this approach to other things in your life not just reading, for example exercise, today I woke up and I run and did some body weight exercises, after studying for 2 hours I went out again for a walk and did stretching exercises, and I’m planning to go for another walk.</p>
