          <h1>How to start programming?</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Start with MOOCS and books that teaches fundamentals, to build a foundation that you can carry on for the rest of life and use whenever you write code.</p>
<p>For example: Object oriented programming, functional programming, algorithms, data structures, math, … this are the things you need to know whenever you want to build a projects or solve a problem.</p>
<p>Those fundamentals don’t change, you can learn them for once and use them for the rest of life.</p>
<p>One thing to avoid (especially as a beginner programmer) is MOOCS or books that are based on new technology (framework, library, language, …) you can pick up this things very quickly if you have strong basics.</p>
