          <h1>Coding curriculum</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>If you went to school to learn coding you will have one curriculum that lasts usually 4 years and you and all of your colleagues are going to follow this curriculum until the end.</p>
<p>But if you are a self taught and you try to learn from the internet then you don’t have this privilege! </p>
<p>There’s thousands of potential curriculum you can pick up! And that’s a bad news!</p>
<p>Why? Because it’s a reason to lose focus, and get distracted.</p>
<p>Computer science students succeed at learning code and getting a job in the field because they focused on a particular path, on a set of assignments and projects,  specific books to read, lectures to attend, so they spend the 4 years learning and making progress instead of overthinking over what course to taker, which book to read, what is the best programming language, … etc.</p>
<p>We need to learn from this students and apply some of their rules as self taught learners.</p>
<p>Instead of overthinking the process break down your curriculum one MOOC, book, projects, problem at a time.</p>
<p>Simply focus on doing one thing at a time and turn down any other option.</p>
<p>Why? To make progress, to stay focused and actually learn the skill and if you made a mistake on choosing a learning project you can always fix that on the next one so you are always on progress. </p>
<p>As Steve Jobs said:</p>
<p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.</p>
