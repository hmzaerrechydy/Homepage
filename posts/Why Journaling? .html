          <h1>Why Journaling? </h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Journaling helps you make decisions you might not make, you slow down and make room for novel thoughts. </p>
<p>Passages I liked from the book (Rework) I was reading today : </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When you don’t know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. But when you stand for something, decisions are obvious. </p>
  <p>Raising money is incredibly distracting.</p>
  <p>Great companies start in garages all the time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you really need X can’t you do Y? This is a great mental exercise to always to question X which is the expensive option and figure out Y the cheaper, simpler, easier and affordable path. (I learned this from Rework) </p>
<p>Reading a book is a starting point to discover ideas that don’t exist in the book nor your mind. </p>
