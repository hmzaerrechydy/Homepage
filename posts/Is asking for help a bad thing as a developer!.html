          <h1>Is asking for help a bad thing as a developer!</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Learn to ask for help.</p>
<p>When building a project, working on an assignment, or solving a problem you will get stuck somewhere on the road after trying so hard to find a solution and write your own code.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Work even harder and don’t look for the hints, no!</p>
<p>You will end up only wasting time, or giving up.</p>
<p>Asking for help is not a weakness in programming but a skill that you need to develop and master.</p>
<p>The most brilliant programmers still ask questions and learn from their peers.</p>
<p>After trying so hard go look up help, learn, apply what you’ve learned and move to the next problem, assignment or project.</p>
