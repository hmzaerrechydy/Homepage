          <h1>Decisions are progress </h1>
          <br/>
            <p>From Rework: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Decisions are progress.</p>
  <p>You want to get into the rhythm of making choices.</p>
  <p>When you put off decisions, they pile up. And piles end up ignored. </p>
  <p>The core of your business should be built around things that won't change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In business and personal life, you simply have to make a decisions and stick with it till the end, that’s the only way to make progress, both in big and small scales: the best writers in the world achieved that because they decided many years ago on this career, they resisted doubt, overthinking, society, … that works not only for the big things in life also for the small daily things, people who are productive and spending their time well are making decisions (and stick to them) this is one of the hardest things to do, it feels painful to not change your mind, it’s like eating the same thing for every meal, we want to do new shiny things, and abandon them when they got boring.</p>
