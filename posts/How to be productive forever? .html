          <h1>How to be productive forever? </h1>
          <br/>
            <p>I was thinking earlier when I was making a cup of coffee in the kitchen about “blogging style”, I decided to treat my blog like a public journal, each blog post is an entry in that journal in which I put: ideas, memories, notes, show progress on projects I am building, share stuff I read, … anything I find interesting and I want to share with you. </p>
<p>We have learned that doubt is good for us in life, that we need to slow down and rethink our decision many times before acting, but in my case (maybe you too could have struggle with this) this pushed me to overthink everything I tried to do in life, I take a step today, the next day I am thinking all day whether this is the right move in life, years has passed and I am still in this infinite loop of rethinking and doubting every single move I take. </p>
<p>Just do it is a good solution to this problem, let me give you two examples of how this might help you in both the long and short term:</p>
<p>let’s say you wake up in the morning and you don’t know what to do, you are lost, you could sit down and think for the rest of the day, or just make the decision of doing something useful like reading a book for 1 hour, or exercise out in nature later on in the day you will find that this decisions were right decision even though you were not sure when you decided to do this two things you will be happy that you did this and avoided overthinking that would had just lead you to procrastination and running your whole day. </p>
<p>Imagine you are a college student (if you are not, if you are don’t imagine okay) and you have free time after studying that you don’t know what you want to do with it, you can spend this time thinking like I did for years or for example you can decide to learn coding, a valuable skill to learn, and you spent the upcoming months learning and practicing this craft till you became super good at it, now at this stage you will able to do things you were not able to do few moths ago like freelancing as a developer, applying for SWE jobs, or building your own software product / startup, this opportunities were not available few months ago but because you decided to spend your time doing something useful like learning code instead of thinking you are now able to do this things. </p>
<p>This are two examples of how beneficial making a decision and sticking to it even though you are lost and not sure how things will work up in the future. </p>
<p>But we need to think, right? Yeah sure we all need to think but not overthink block some in your day where you think, 30 minutes or even an hour is more than enough, and spend the majority of your time doing useful things even if you are not sure, here’s the problem you will never be sure, being sure is a choice, you can be sure, or you can’t be, it’s up to you. </p>
