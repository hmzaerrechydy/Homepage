          <h1>Get a job!</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>I’m a college student and I want a job!</p>
<p>It’s not a cool thing, college students should instead think about: building a startup and becoming the next young billionaire, creating the next social media platform, … etc.</p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>The internet turned the normal path that the majority of people take which is studying and finding a job an old, inefficient, stupid and not cool thing to do.</p>
<p>You are not an exception, you want prove? If you are an exception then you will be already doing something and you are successful with it.</p>
<p>Slow down, relax, don’t rush, and take the normal path to progress.</p>
<p>Go to school and study hard, and your goal should be getting a job! Yes a boring but realistic and good thing to aim for.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, it’s a problem that we think about the big stuff like: passion, wealth, … and we forget to solve first the small, emergent and true problems we have: food, shelter, a nice place where there’s opportunity, transportation; a better computer.</p>
<p>As a college student in my first year I learned that my job is to learn! To acquire skills, knowledge and experience I need in the job market.</p>
<p>Studying is part of this learning but it’s not enough, I need to do other stuff, for example I’m learning to code.</p>
<p>Mainly there’s two activities you have to do learning and networking!</p>
<p>Learning can be anything that develops skills: Studying, learning to code, learning a language, it can be also building a startup, an application, starting a YouTube channel, writing a book, … but you have to do this stuff not to make money and become rich but to learn and build a portfolio.</p>
<p>Putting yourself out there and developing new relationships is your second job, do it simultaneously with learning, opportunities don’t come knocking on people’s doors, you should be looking for it, asking people, and offering your service.</p>
<p>That’s what I believe young people like me should do, then after getting a job and solving those basic but essential life problems you will have the luxury to think about bigger problems and the next thing to do, but don’t escape steps.</p>
