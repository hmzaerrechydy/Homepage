<p>I don’t know why! I spend a lot of time doing online courses but I still suck at coding, I don’t feel I am making progress, I think setting at home and just following course after course is not really smart thing to do to learn stuff. </p>
<p>Instead I think it’s better to learn by doing, instead of doing courses, build something, for example if you want to learn to code build an application or freelance as a developer and offer your service for free, there’s countless of things you can do it depends on what you want. </p>
<p>Learning by doing is much faster, it’s real world, you meet hard problems, you gain real experience, and you learn the useful parts that are actually needed in real world.</p>
<p>So (I’m talking to myself and maybe to you too) instead of spending countless time taking courses and tutorials and building those to do list projects that has nothing to do with the real world, learning should happen in a real life environment, go and build something and do something you would love to do and it should be a rich experience of learning and it should be challenging, it’s great because you do something which is more fun, you learn and acquire skills and knowledge, and also you are productive and adding value to others. </p>
<p>Practice, then fill the gaps trough the process with theory trough videos, articles, maybe a course or tutorial but then you know exactly what you need you get it and leave to keep building or doing whatever you want. </p>
<p>Also read books, books are great source of knowledge and wisdom that can help you along the journey, and also a fascinating source of theory for fields like programming or design, and opens your mind to more ideas you never thought of. </p>
<p>This blog post is for me because I’m making this mistake of focusing on taking online courses and ignoring building real things. </p>
