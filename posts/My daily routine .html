          <h1>My daily routine </h1>
          <br/>
            <p>In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.</p>
<p>I have found that having a daily routine helps me stay productive, giving a structure to my day helped me to: make progress daily, become more consistent, make the right decisions, and stay balanced. </p>
<p>Here is my daily routine: </p>
<p>Morning + Afternoon = Work (I mean by work anything serious: work, exercise, studying, reading, learning a skill, …) </p>
<p>Evening = Leisure + non-optional work (things I have to do and can’t delay for tomorrow like praying) + light work (things that take few minutes to complete)</p>
<p>Night = Sleep</p>
<p>Here is my philosophy behind this routine: (1) Balance, 50% of the day (morning; afternoon) is for work and being productive and the other 50% (evening; night) is for rest, leisure and giving myself time to recover and get back on the best physical, mental and emotional state to tackle the next day. (2) Consistency, this routine will not enable me to do something for 10 hours straight but it will help me if Allah will to stay consistent and show up to do the work for the next 40 or 50 years (I’m 21) people must work hard on being consistent over the years not on intensity over few days or weeks. (3) Doing work that we don’t like to do like exercise, reading, studying, learning, solving problems requires attention, focus, discipline and this things are scarce and because I work only on the morning and the afternoon I become more focused because this is the only window of time where I can make progress so instead of procrastination I find myself rushing to do work. </p>
<p>A’isha reported God’s Messenger as saying, “The acts most pleasing to God are those which are done most continuously, even if they amount to little.”</p>
<p>(Bukhari and Muslim.)</p>
