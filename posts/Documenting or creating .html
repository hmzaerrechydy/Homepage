<p>I was thinking about whether to document or create? either use social media and this blog to create content where I go and try to create something new, from scratch, and follow some sort of structure, and treat this blog like a magazine, or just share ideas, stuff, links, notes, … and document the process and things I learned and do. </p>
<p>When you start this blogging (and social media) thing you gotta make this choice. </p>
<p>I picked up documenting, here’s why: </p>
<p>Creating is hard, it takes a lot of time and energy, blogging (and social media) is not my job, is not what I want to do and make money from, so it’s a wise choice to save this energy and time for my job, the thing I want to make money from, documenting on the other hand is easier and simpler because I already done the work of capturing ideas, notes, things I learned, … and I only had to do a little bit of editing and then share this content. </p>
<p>Documenting is part of the process of creating, if I was creating here also then I would not have a place to document the process, I shouldn’t be just creating I also need to document the thing I’m creating. </p>
<p>The overall reason why I blog and share content on social media is to connect with people and opportunities, and I think documenting is better for this purpose because you show who you are and what you are doing behind the scenes and also you are publishing what skills and things you are learning and creating to match with the opportunities that are out there and people who looking for you. </p>
