<h3 id="interpreter">interpreter</h3>
<p>an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.</p>
<p>Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command.</p>

<p>I feel happy about moving from C to Python, it's just simple, smooth and beautiful, but that's the point from learning C to know the underlying logic and fundamentals of programming so you can use Python or any other language like JavaScript, Ruby, … better.</p>
<p>Your Python program will take more time to run than a C program because you use advanced or high level concepts, functions and other people's code that the computers needs to figure out so it will take an extra time, on the other hand in C you are writing a lot of things by yourself so the computer doesn't have to spend more time executing other people's code so it's faster, but that's the trade-off in Python the programmer saves time while coding.</p>
<p>Python doesn't have arrays instead it had lists, now I understand this statement, Python doesn't have an array that stores items in one chunk of memory back to back, before learning C and data structures I used to compare only the syntax, the brackets […] and I didn't understand why they say Python doesn't have arrays while it had brackets!</p>
<h3 id="range">range()</h3>
<p>This function returns a list of X items.</p>
<p>To save memory it doesn't provide you with the whole list at once, it presents one item at a time.</p>
<h3 id="truncation">Truncation</h3>
<p>truncation means to chop off the decimal portion of a number.</p>
<h3 id="floatingpointimprecision">floating point imprecision</h3>
<p>One way of understanding "why" is to realize that there are an infinite number of floating point numbers. But you are storing it into a finite number of bits in memory. So the number of different numbers you can store is finite; some approximation is going to have to be made for some numbers.</p>
<p>There's no more integer overflow because Python will give you more bits as you need them.</p>
<h3 id="stringsareimmutableinpython">strings are immutable in python</h3>
<p>In Python, strings are made immutable so that programmers cannot alter the contents of the object but you can get a copy, but you can't change the original string in memory.</p>
<h3 id="maininpython">main in Python</h3>
<p>You can define a main function in Python at the top of your file program but you don't have to add at the top prototypes of functions you will declare later on, so the main function helps you execute those functions that are not defined yet, but you have to execute or invoke main at the end of the file this doesn't happen automatically as in C.</p>
<h3 id="tryexcept">try/except</h3>
<p>You can use <strong>try</strong> to try execute a block of code and if something wrong happens <strong>except</strong> will handle this and react by printing an error or something else you chose to happen in this case.</p>
<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
<p>You can use variables outside of their scope.</p>
<p>This was a really fun lecture, I enjoyed it.</p>
