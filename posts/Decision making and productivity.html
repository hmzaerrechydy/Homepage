          <h1>Decision making and productivity</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.</p>
<p>To be a productive person you need to be a great decision maker, your day is a series if decisions, let’s say you can make 10 decision per day, if you make 10 good choices then you have a great day, if you make 10 bad choices you have a bad day, and if you made 0 decisions then it’s worse than the bad 10 choices! I see overthinking and doubt as a real issue that stops progress, instead you should be quick, easy and simple, if what you will do is good, meaningful, useful and will help you in life in whatever way then do it, and it will open other doors later on for other things. </p>
