          <h1>Do something for the next 10 years</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Be on of the few people who will do something for the next 10 years without quitting.</p>
<p>It can be: reading, exercise, building a business, writing, …</p>
<p>Consistency is much harder than intensity, you can work hard for a couple of days or weeks, and make rapid progress, but it’s hard to stick with something for 10 years or longer every day, try to imagine the mental capacity you need to do such thing, you need to be disciplined, wise and able to do work and make progress in the most uncertain and dark times. </p>
<p>The longer you stay in the game the more coins you earn.</p>
<p>People start, work hard, and quit, it’s an infinite loop, you need to stay long enough to see real results.</p>
<p>Once you understand that results requires consistency and time you will realize the importance of balance and rest.</p>
