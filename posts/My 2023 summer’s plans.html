          <h1>My 2023 summer’s plans</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>It’s summer vacation, I finished my first year in college. Let me tell you about my plans for this summer:</p>
<h3 id="learningtocode">Learning to code</h3>
<p>I already started, but in this summer I want coding to be my primary focus, I decided to spend the mornings coding and the afternoons doing other stuff, I want to develop skill, currently I want to take MOOCs and read books that teaches the fundamentals and terminology of programming and computer science, at the end of the summer it will be great if I could finish a couple of MOOCs / books, solve some problems, and build a project or two.</p>
<h3 id="learningfrench">Learning French</h3>
<p>I’m learning French currently, in this vacation I want to focus more on practicing my language trough writing and speaking.</p>
<h3 id="buildingmywebsite">Building my website</h3>
<p>I want to create a website to publish my blogs posts, projects and share stuff I like (books, articles, podcasts, … ) at the end of summer I would love to have an up and running website on the internet that I could share with people.</p>
<h3 id="readmoreconsumemorecontent">Read more; consume more content</h3>
<p>I want to finish more books, in different fields and categories, also I want to consume different types of content: Articles, videos, podcasts, … consuming content online is a great way to find unique ideas you might not find in books and also get to know new people and expand your network.</p>
<h3 id="thinkweek">Think Week</h3>
<p>I want to spend some time thinking more long term, if you are not familiar a think week is a week you spend only thinking about your life, business, problems, … etc, Bill Gates does this twice in the year maybe and he’s the one that popularized this concept.</p>
<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<p>I want to develop new relationships, and expand my network, I’m going to use social media to achieve that.</p>
<p>At the end of the summer I will write a blog post sharing the results and what I did in this vacation.</p>
