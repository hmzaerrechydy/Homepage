<p><a href="http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html">Alan Perlis</a>&nbsp;once said: "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing".</p>
<p>Researchers (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034531509X/">Bloom (1985)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html#bh">Bryan & Harter (1899)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805803092">Hayes (1989)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html#sc">Simmon & Chase (1973)</a>) have shown it takes about ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, including chess playing, music composition, telegraph operation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in neuropsychology and topology. The key is&nbsp;<em>deliberative</em>&nbsp;practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again.</p>
<p>True expertise may take a lifetime. </p>
<p>Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) said "Excellence in any department can be attained only by the labor of a lifetime; it is not to be purchased at a lesser price.”</p>
<p>Chaucer (1340-1400) complained "the lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne.”</p>
<p>As Prof.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/K.-Anders-Ericsson/e/B000APB8AQ/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1">K. Anders Ericsson</a>&nbsp;puts it, "In most domains it's remarkable how much time even the most talented individuals need in order to reach the highest levels of performance. The 10,000 hour number just gives you a sense that we're talking years of 10 to 20 hours a week which those who some people would argue are the most innately talented individuals still need to get to the highest level."</p>
<p><strong>Program</strong>. The best kind of learning is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-120-pg.html">learning by doing</a>. To put it more technically, "the maximal level of performance for individuals in a given domain is not attained automatically as a function of extended experience, but the level of performance can be increased even by highly experienced individuals as a result of deliberate efforts to improve."&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.umassd.edu/swpi/DesignInCS/expertise.html">(p. 366)</a>&nbsp;and "the most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an appropriate difficulty level for the particular individual, informative feedback, and opportunities for repetition and corrections of errors." (p. 20-21) The book&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521357349"><em>Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics, and Culture in Everyday Life</em></a>&nbsp;is an interesting reference for this viewpoint.</p>
<p>Learn at least a half dozen&nbsp;<strong>programming languages</strong>. Include one language that emphasizes class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that emphasizes functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML or Haskell), one that supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates), and one that emphasizes parallelism (like Clojure or Go).</p>
<p>Remember that there is a "<strong>computer</strong>" in "computer science". Know how long it takes your computer to execute an instruction, fetch a word from memory (with and without a cache miss), read consecutive words from disk, and seek to a new location on disk.
