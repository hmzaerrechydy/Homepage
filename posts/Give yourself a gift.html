          <h1>Give yourself a gift</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Learn to evaluate yourself and your work.</p>
<p>Give yourself positive feedback, say nice things to yourself!</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>To keep going. If you are working hard and all you do to yourself is punishment and feeling of guilt then you will not sustain it, and doing nothing will be as equal to doing something useful because you adopt yourself to get the same output from both activities or modes.</p>
<p>Learn to appreciate the stuff you do.</p>
<p>I know that criticizing yourself and learning from the mistakes you do is good to make progress and develop your character and skills but if you take it to the extreme you will suffer and gain the opposite results: decline instead of development.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s all about balance.</p>
<p>Criticize but at the same time be your best fan, friend and motivator.</p>
<p>Give yourself gifts and rewards.</p>
