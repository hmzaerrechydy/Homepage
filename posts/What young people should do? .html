          <h1>What young people should do? </h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Do not rush your career!</p>
<p>Get a job, solve the basic problems of life first: food, shelter, clothing, … </p>
<p>Then maybe you will like just stay as an employee, you might enjoy it, not everybody should become an entrepreneur. Or actually start some kind of side project or activity you would like to do. </p>
<p>But if your rush on starting something before getting a job and fail, and you don’t have any money you will feel depressed, you will not make good decisions because all you think about is making money as fast as possible which I believe will never lead to good work.</p>
<p>Or worse you might not even start something and just spend years and years just trying to figure out what you wanna do with life which is horrible waste of time, there’s a lot of wanna be entrepreneurs out there that all they do is thinking and overthinking!!!</p>
<p>Instead learn, acquire knowledge and skills, either trough: college, internships, books, courses, projects, or even build a business! to learn not to earn, expect to fail because there’s a high chance you will do but if something catches great turn it into a full time job if you wanted to. There’s a lot of ways to learn pick one, or a combination of this methods, forget about money, and focus on learning. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Be so good they can’t ignore you —Steve Martin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true you need to be so good, trough learning you will become great at things, but you need to tell people about what you are doing, the skills you have, the things you have built so they can decide then to ignore you or not. </p>
<p>Social media, blogging, YouTube, … all of this are tools you can pick up to connect. </p>
<p>The sad thing about young people that we tend to rush and focus on earning not learning, don’t fall into this trap, get so good, get a job, then experiment on the side (if you wanted to) you will then have money and the peace of mind (which is huge important to making a project a success) to experiment till you succeed and find something you like to do beside the job or instead of the job then only at that stage of life you can afford doing something like that. </p>
<p>This might not sound cool, but I think it’s an efficient way of doing things for most of us. </p>
