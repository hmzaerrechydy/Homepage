          <h1>floating point imprecision</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>There are an infinite number of floating point numbers. But you are storing it into a finite number of bits in memory. So the number of different numbers you can store is finite; some guess is going to have to be made for some numbers that were not stored in memory when you try to access those numbers. </p>
