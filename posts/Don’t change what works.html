<p>I don’t know why but we love suffering and getting ourselves stuck, we start doing something, we figured things out, and now it works great, but suddenly we start thinking about changing it! </p>
<p>Well there’s a lot of reasons that might cause that weird act like social media, which is I think the most common cause, you are for example taking notes in a certain way using an application that does the job and it’s fine but suddenly you come across a video on YouTube celebrating another note taking app and describe it as the best note taking tool ever and it has this new features … </p>
<p>So automatically we start thinking about making a change. </p>
<p>But what is the problem with that? can it hurt? of course yes, because it kills progress, instead of doing the work we start thinking just about how to do the work best, we argue over the tools and we forgot about the outcome, it kills consistency, you start, you are inspired about what you are doing but another video come and promises you with a better, faster, cooler, … way of doing what you do, so you start and quit, start, quit, start, quit, … an infinite loop. </p>
<p>This happened to me with learning to code, I start a course, super excited about it, but I saw another video or blog post talking about this other great course, so I quit and start doubting my choice, after few days of quitting I went back with a new decision, and as you expect I come across this other new cool language, frameworks, course, book, website … or whatever so I got back to level zero. </p>
<p>This applied also to exercising, whenever you start exercising in a way, some one on the internet come to you showing his better routine, so you quit, you overthink it, you start, and you quit again because of the same reason. </p>
<p>This is dangerous because you might waste a lot of time and you still on the same spot. </p>
<p>What is the solution then? well it’s a process I can’t tell you something that you can apply today and solve this problem for a lifetime, but I have some tips that you can use as a starting point: </p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t change what works: if you use or do something and it works well then there’s no need to change ignore this feelings, videos, articles … that pushes you toward change, it’s hard but it works, but you should be aware of what is good enough for you and be responsible for it so when new products, methods and features are offered to you, you know whether they will fulfill needs you don’t have now, if not just ignore, awareness is the keyword here.</li>
<li>Prioritize consistency over routine or features: just do whatever you need to do in whatever way possible, for example: exercise, no matter how: walk, run, body-weight training, stretching, … just do any of that.</li>
<li>Do then think: don’t start your day with thinking, it will translate into overthinking and then procrastination, and you will prefer to just do nothing over doing something useful, so start your day by doing, but I’m lost I don’t know what to do? just do anything useful: walk, read, run, write, … this will lead to better outcome in life: health, knowledge, … then later in the day you can think, thinking will never end so if you prioritize it you will spend your whole life thinking and never get done anything.</li>
</ul>
