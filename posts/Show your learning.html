          <h1>Show your learning</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Make the thing you wish you had found&nbsp;when you were learning.</p>
<p>Try your best to be right, but don’t worry when you’re wrong.&nbsp;Repeatedly. If you feel uncomfortable, or like an impostor, good. You’re pushing yourself. Don’t assume you know everything, but try your best anyway, and let the internet correct you when you are inevitably wrong.</p>
<p>Teaching is the best way to learn.</p>
<p>Eventually, they’ll want to pay you for your help too. A lot more than you think.</p>
