          <h1>Hack life</h1>
          <br/>
            <p>Figure out your job one day at a time.</p>
<p>If you want to do something, but you’re stuck, then you are thinking and planning more than necessary.</p>
<p>Plans, values and methods are good things but don’t be obsessed with this stuff and neglect daily progress.</p>
<p>You don’t have to know what you will do in the next 6 months, but you must know what you are going to do TODAY.</p>
<p>Shift your focus from long term and abstract perspective to this day and make a decision that fits this day, do what you can do, make progress, solve real problems you have, fix broken stuff, do something measurable, of value, something that is beneficial today and tomorrow, then spend a little bit of time thinking about the future and big ideas.</p>
<p>I apply this way of operating as a student, each day I spend a block of time (30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours) studying, doing assignments, studying for exams, … anything beneficial and I had to do, each day I figure out what I want to do for that specific day, then from time to time I think a little bit about the future.</p>
<p>Projects whether It’s studying, job, business, writing a book, … is like climbing a mountain, you can’t climb it in one step! You need to make thousands of steps, and you can’t figure out where you will put your foot exactly on each step before starting to walk!</p>
